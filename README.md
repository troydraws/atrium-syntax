# Atrium Syntax
## Medium Grey

A nice syntax theme for Atom.

The control freak author suggest that [Overpass Mono](http://overpassfont.org/) to be used as the editor font.

But seriously just use whatever font you like!

There is also an Atrium UI theme to go with this.
And yes that UI theme uses Overpass as its default font.

Have fun!
