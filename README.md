# Atrium Syntax
## Medium Grey

A nice syntax theme for Atom.

The control freak author suggest that [Overpass Mono](http://overpassfont.org/) to be used as the editor font.

But seriously just use whatever font you like!

There is also an [Atrium UI theme](https://github.com/troydraws/atrium-ui) to go with this.
And yes that UI theme uses Overpass as its default font.
